The file reaction_speed.py is a Python script that uses the pyautogui library to automate a reaction speed test on the website humanbenchmark.com. The script takes a screenshot of a single pixel at the coordinates (249, 301) and checks the color of that pixel. If the color is (75, 219, 106), which corresponds to the green color of the "Click!" button on the website, the script clicks on the button by adding 10 pixels to the x and y coordinates of the pixel and using the pyautogui.click() function.
The script runs in an infinite loop until the user interrupts it by pressing Ctrl+C. When the user interrupts the script, the message "Program terminated by user." is printed to the console.
